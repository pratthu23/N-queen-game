1. Main Menu Structure:
- The game runs in a continuous loop (while(true)) showing a menu with 3 options:
  1. Play vs Computer (AI mode)
  2. Play Multiplayer (2 player mode) 
  3. Exit

2. Input Validation:
- The code includes robust input validation using:
  while(!(cin >> choice) || choice < 1 || choice > 3)
- This ensures only valid choices (1-3) are accepted
- Invalid inputs are cleared using cin.clear() and cin.ignore()

3. Game Flow:
- If choice is 3, the program exits
- If choice is 1, it starts a game vs computer (playVsComputer())
- If choice is 2, it starts a multiplayer game (playMultiplayer())

4. Game Logic (shown in previous code):
- Uses makeMove() to place pieces
- Checks for win conditions with isGameOver()
- Alternates between players (1 and 2)
- Displays the board after each move

5. User Experience:
- Clears input buffer with cin.ignore()
- Waits for user input after game ends
- Provides clear menu options and prompts
